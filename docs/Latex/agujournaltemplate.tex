\section{Introduction}


The work of \cite{Vargas2022a} has been fundamental for the development of IKER.


\section{Materials and Methods}
Here is text on Materials and Methods. And it should not give errors right?




\subsection{Study site}
The GDD is part of a system of caves 

\subsection{Climatological settings}
Ecuador, located in North-Western South America, has tropical climate 

\subsection{Statistical Analysis}
We share the believe that only the simultaneous and flexible application of more than one spectral estimation method can provide truly reliable information on a given time series, 



\section{Results}

From KR9 abstract proff Spötl. A good researcher that I met was \cite{Ujvari2024} at EGU2024. In addition, another good paper I encountered is the one from \cite{Feakins2016} comparing leaf waxes. 

\citeA{Vargas2022a} indicates that the western is different than the eastern. I agree on that as it is myself saying it. Here I have corrected the spelling \cite{Orrison2024}, but not really!!!. 

\citeA{Vargas2022a} noted that writing here is better


Preliminary results show that total annual precipitation in the site is >4000 mm, which provides permanent availability of water in the region, allowing for strong karst development. High precipitation amounts in the area are reflected by cave hydrology, as suggested by measured drip rates and some stalagmite fabrics which indicate a fast growth. However, despite the high and uniform precipitation rates, there are two significant increases in rainfall in the year (Mar-May and Oct-Nov) showing the most depleted isotope composition (< -12‰ and < -7‰ respectively) and are related to the amount effect and displacement of the ITCZ. Registered temperatures inside the caves show minimum variation through the year (19.2 ± 0.2 °C) and reflect the mean annual air temperature (~19.0 ± 2.0 °C).

The temperature (19.2 $ \pm $ 0.2 $ \, ^\circ \mathrm{C} $) and reflect the changes in the

Cena is not my favorite


\section{Discussion}

Consider what was said in IC038 Seimond et al 1999 that recycling is enhanced during the rainy periods when the ITCZ crosses Ecuador and makes the d18O signal depleted due to recycling of moisture that increases the d16O and depletion due to rainout (amount effect). So apparently, there is an interplay of both effects that lowers the d18O values. Preliminary, this is also observed in the Quito stations, but we need longer monitoring. Here I consider the work of \cite{Vargas2022a} fundamental for the MONEY and beyond.

% DATA SECTION and ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section*{Open Research Section}
This section MUST contain a statement that describes where the data supporting the conclusions can be obtained. Data cannot be listed as ''Available from authors'' or stored solely in supporting information. Citations to archived data should be included in your reference list. Wiley will publish it as a separate section on the paper’s page. Examples and complete information are here:
https://www.agu.org/Publish with AGU/Publish/Author Resources/Data for Authors

\section*{As Applicable – Inclusion in Global Research Statement}
The Authorship: Inclusion in Global Research policy aims to promote greater equity and transparency in research collaborations. AGU Publications encourage research collaborations between regions, countries, and communities and expect authors to include their local collaborators as co-authors when they meet the AGU Publications authorship criteria (described here: https://www.agu.org/publications/authors/policies\#authorship). Those who do not meet the criteria should be included in the Acknowledgement section. We encourage researchers to consider recommendations from The TRUST CODE - A Global Code of Conduct for Equitable Research Partnerships (https://www.globalcodeofconduct.org/) when conducting and reporting their research, as applicable, and encourage authors to include a disclosure statement pertaining to the ethical and scientific considerations of their research collaborations in an “Inclusion in Global Research Statement’ as a standalone section in the manuscript following the Conclusions section. This can include disclosure of permits, authorizations, permissions and/or any formal agreements with local communities or other authorities, additional acknowledgements of local help received, and/or description of end-users of the research. You can learn more about the policy in this editorial. Example statements can be found in the following published papers: 
Holt et al. (https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022JG007188), 
Sánchez-Gutiérrez et al. (https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2023JG007554), 
Tully et al. (https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2022JG007128) 
Please note that these statements are titled as “Global Research Collaboration Statements” from a previous pilot requirement in JGR Biogeosciences. The pilot has ended and statements should now be titled “Inclusion in Global Research Statement”.

%
%  EQUATIONS
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Single-line equations are centered.
% Equation arrays will appear left-aligned.

Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]
 will not be numbered, e.g.,:
 \[ x^2=y^2 + z^2\]

 Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
 be automatically numbered, e.g.,:
 \begin{equation}
 x^2=y^2 + z^2
 \end{equation}


% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

% If you are using line numbers, remember to surround
% equations with \begin{linenomath*}...\end{linenomath*}

%  To add line numbers to lines in equations:
%  \begin{linenomath*}
%  \begin{equation}
