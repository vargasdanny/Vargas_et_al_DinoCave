## Abstract


## Plain Language

## 1. Introduction
Recent initiatives about climate change in Ecuador show that there is a lack of understanding and information regarding this topic.
Little is known about past climate or it has not been well communicated or there is lack of connection/link between the fields, despite Ecuador being such a diverse country (Cáceres et al., 1998; Toulkeridis et al., 2020; Yánez-Moretta et al., 2011)
New models and forecasts have been developed for Ecuador (Campozano et al., 2020; Chimborazo and Vuille, 2021). but little is known about past climates, maybe due to the unlinked/spatially distant areas where the records come from or the lack of a common time-scale for its comparison. 

Tropical regions are principally affected by the seasonal excursions of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) (ref). Currently there are several views for this

## 2. Materials and Methods

### 2.1 Study site
The GDD is part of a system of caves formed by the watershed of a small stream that runs into the Puyo River roughly .55 km downstream. The cave has two entrances, a high and dry entrance that is a common tourist route, and a lower entrance where the principal stream runs under ground forming a long, tight tunnel filled with water, later opening up into a series of large rooms. The overall cave is characterized by a network of corridors (1-3 m wide, 3-4 m tall) with intermittent larger rooms (5-20 m wide, 4-9 m tall). There is a complex system of small streams and corridors that span multiple vertical levels. In total the cave reaches a vertical depth from ground level of XX and a horizontal distance from the entrances of XX). There is XX km of total distance of the tunnels. Although many of the cave’s speleothems have been damaged by tourism and military training, the deepest rooms still contain clean and impressive formations, which we were able to sample as part of the present study.

 

### 2.2 Climatological settings
Ecuador, located in North-Western South America, has tropical climate which dynamics are primarily driven by the presence of the Andean cordilleras (Western and Eastern), periodic fluctuations of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), making it a climatologically interesting area for the study of past climate. With this regard, there is only one speleothem-based paleoclimate record in Ecuador, but information about cave monitoring and isotopic composition of precipitation is still sparse.
Therefore, three caves within the Napo Cretaceous limestone formation, in the Amazonian Central Ecuador, were selected for paleoclimate study purposes. The karst system is located at 1200 m a.s.l. with several explored caves, some of them exposing claystone layers or layers of bituminous limestone. The caves have mostly vadose to epiphreatic passages, rich in various vadose speleothems, including pool speleothems, stalactites and stalagmites. From all of them, we have collected some already broken stalagmites as well as bedrock samples for various geochemical analyses. Ongoing cave monitoring started at two of the caves in February 2019 and comprises a recording of air temperatures on an hourly rate at two locations inside and two outside the caves. Dripping water is collected quarterly for δ18O and δ2H analyses. In addition, some measurements of drip water pH, T, total alkalinity and drip rate were made during the visit. The monitoring program of local precipitation was also initiated, and it includes a collection of composite monthly rainfall samples for isotopic analyses (δ18O, δ2H, 3H).
 

### 2.3 Statistical Analysis
We share the believe that only the simultaneous and flexible application of more than one spectral estimation method can provide truly reliable information on a given time series, when the signal-to-noise ratio is low (Ghil et al., 2002; Kondrashov and Ghil, 2006).

Concerning the statistical analysis of paleoclimate time series, there are usually two approaches, the time domain and the frequency domain (Shumway and Stoffer, 2017). Nevertheless, for the determination of periodic components, we opted for the latter through spectral analysis employing (cite programs)

We employed statistical techniques which did not require interpolation of the uneven time series, which has been shown might alter the high frequency spectrum “red-noise” (Mudelsee, 2014; Schulz, 1996; Schulz and Mudelsee, 2002). 

It is typical in paleoclimate time series to fit an AR(1) model implying a short term memory related to the previous value lag-1 (Hasselmann, 1976; Mudelsee, 2014). Nevertheless, recent research shows that AR(1) model might not be a good candidate for high-order processes and power-law models stands out as indicative of long memory (Agnew, 1992; Clauset et al., 2009; Xu, 2019).

## 3. Results

#From KR9 abstract
Preliminary results show that total annual precipitation in the site is >4000 mm, which provides permanent availability of water in the region, allowing for strong karst development. High precipitation amounts in the area are reflected by cave hydrology, as suggested by measured drip rates and some stalagmite fabrics which indicate a fast growth. However, despite the high and uniform precipitation rates, there are two significant increases in rainfall in the year (Mar-May and Oct-Nov) showing the most depleted isotope composition (< -12‰ and < -7‰ respectively) and are related to the amount effect and displacement of the ITCZ. Registered temperatures inside the caves show minimum variation through the year (19.2 ± 0.2 °C) and reflect the mean annual air temperature (~19.0 ± 2.0 °C).



## 4. Discussion

Consider what was said in  IC038_Seimond et al.1998, that recycling is enhanced during the rainy periods when the ITCZ crosses Ecuador and makes the d18O signal depleted due to recycling of moisture that increases the d16O and depletion due to rainout (amount effect). So apparently, there is an interplay of both effects that lowers the d18O values. Preliminary, this is also observed in the Quito stations, but we need longer monitoring.
