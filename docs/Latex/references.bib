abstract = {The lack of delimitation between the South American Monsoon System (SAMS) and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) has led to problematic calibration of archives in paleoclimate studies, particularly in northern South America. We show for the first time recorded in a paleoclimate archive that the ITCZ is the primary controller of oxygen ($\delta$18OTR) and carbon ($\delta$13CTR) isotopes in Cedrela nebulosa tree-rings (1864–2018). In contrast, a monsoonal pattern is not observed at this latitude. Spatial correlations revealed that $\delta$18OTR better reflects months of higher precipitation (March–June) in the western Amazon than local rainout processes at decadal time scale, owing to the strong convection in the basin at this time of the year. Similarly, this study identified cloud cover as a vital controller in sunshine duration, which influences the phenology of Cedrela nebulosa. We interpret the variability of the $\delta$13CTR as an enhancement in the photosynthetic rate during light-increased months (July–September), strongly regulated by cloudiness reduction when the ITCZ rain band retreats to northwestern South America in austral winter. Overall, these results reveals that Cedrela nebulosa is well-adapted to wet environments, and its cellulose-based stable isotopic signals reflect the direct influence of the ITCZ excursions from austral autumn to winter with minimal SAMS control.},

abstract = {Plant leaf waxes have been found to record the hydrogen isotopic composition of precipitation and are thus used to reconstruct past climate. To assess how faithfully they record hydrological signals, we characterize leaf wax hydrogen isotopic compositions in forest canopy trees across a highly biodiverse, 3km elevation range on the eastern flank of the Andes. We sampled the dominant tree species and assessed their relative abundance in the tree community. For each tree we collected xylem and leaf samples for analysis of plant water and plant leaf wax hydrogen isotopic compositions. In total, 176 individuals were sampled across 32 species and 5 forest plots that span the gradient. We find both xylem water and leaf wax $\delta$D values of individuals correlate (R2=0.8 and R2=0.3 respectively) with the isotopic composition of precipitation (with an elevation gradient of −21‰km−1). Minimal leaf water enrichment means that leaf waxes are straightforward recorders of the isotopic composition of precipitation in wet climates. For these tropical forests we find the average fractionation between source water and leaf wax for C29 n-alkanes, −129±2‰ (s.e.m., n=136), to be indistinguishable from that of temperate moist forests. For C28 n-alkanoic acids the average fractionation is −121±3‰ (s.e.m., n=102). Sampling guided by community assembly within forest plots shows that integrated plant leaf wax hydrogen isotopic compositions faithfully record the gradient of isotopes in precipitation with elevation (R2=0.97 for n-alkanes and 0.60 for n-alkanoic acids). This calibration study supports the use of leaf waxes as recorders of the isotopic composition of precipitation in lowland tropical rainforest, tropical montane cloud forests and their sedimentary archives.},

abstract = {Pleistocene loess records of the Khovaling Loess Plateau (KLP) in Tajikistan provide rich collections of lithic artifacts demonstrating past human presence in the region. To understand the timing of human activity and environmental conditions prevailing at that time U–Th dating and clumped/stable C/O isotope measurements have been applied to modern and Pleistocene soil carbonates (SCs) collected at several sites on the KLP and surroundings. U–Th ages were corrected by two methods: 1) assuming an initial [230Th/232Th] activity ratio of 0.85 ± 0.25 based on gamma spectrometry of loess/paleosol samples, and 2) the isochron technique using leachates and fully dissolved subsamples. Diagenetic alteration and potential U/Th mobilization and related isotope fractionation due to alpha-recoil was also modelled and found to be minor in the studied soil carbonates. Compared to model ages as references, uncorrected 230Th ages are only acceptable if measured [230Th/232Th] activity ratios of leachates are high (>30), while 230Th ages derived using method 1 are mostly overcorrected. It appears that SCs can be reliably dated by the U-series disequilibrium method in this sedimentary setting, but isochron dating cannot be spared. Application of the isochron method is required to derive 230Thmodel ages, which ensures that the non-zero initial 230Th and possible U–Th gain/loss due to alpha-recoil can be simultaneously corrected and reliable U–Th ages obtained. U–Th ages of Pleistocene SCs clearly demonstrate post-pedogenic ingrowth of multiple, non-contemporaneous populations of SCs within loess/paleosol units, and that SC formation happened in many cases under cold, presumably dry glacial climate conditions. Considering that U–Th ages of SCs provide minimum ages of the sediment in which they form, these ages can be useful in developing loess stratigraphic models and for correlation of paleosols with marine isotope stages. This implies that the age of a given paleosol and any lithic artifacts it may contain, indicating human activity, cannot be younger than the age of SCs formed in that paleosol. This is due to the nature of soil carbonates, which can be the product of both syn- and post-depositional processes. Clumped isotope thermometry of SCs collected from modern soils at three sites in Tajikistan provide evidence for SCs dominantly recording summer season soil temperatures, while the calculated soil water oxygen isotope signatures reflect annual signals and carbonate precipitation from source waters incorporating rainfall from prior to and during SC formation. In contrast, some Pleistocene SCs record soil temperatures and stable isotope compositions more appropriate to glacial conditions, confirming the findings of U–Th ages, and highlighting the primary role of aridity-driven soil moisture changes in SC precipitation in this setting. Considering the interpretative complexities of SC stable isotope compositions, involving issues such as SC formation depth within a soil/paleosol profile, seasonality of SC growth and violation of the law of superposition, SC stable isotope proxy records of past climates cannot be considered as a set of clearly sequential data through time. This implies that such SC-based stable isotope records must be accompanied by U–Th dating of carbonates to be meaningful.},

abstract = {Abstract The South American summer monsoon (SASM) generates important hydroclimatic impacts in (sub-)tropical South America and isotopic tracers recorded in paleoclimatic archives allow for assessing its long-term response to Pacific variability prior to modern observations. Stable oxygen isotopes in precipitation integrate hydroclimatic changes during the SASM mature phase from December to February (DJF) in response to the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) and El Ni{\~{n}}o?Southern Oscillation (ENSO), respectively. Here, results from the isotope-enabled Community Atmosphere Model v.5 are compared with highly resolved and precisely dated isotopic records from speleothems, tree rings, lake and ice cores during the industrial era (1880?2000 CE) and validated against observations from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) network. Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are coupled to the isotopic composition of SASM precipitation through perturbations in the Walker circulation associated with low- (IPO) and high-frequency (ENSO) variability, impacting convective activity over tropical South America and the tropical Atlantic. Changes in convection over this monsoon entrance region ultimately control the downstream oxygen isotopic composition of precipitation recorded in paleoclimate archives. Overall, model results, paleoclimate records and IAEA data agree on the isotopic response to Pacific SST forcing. These results highlight the potential for long isotopic paleoclimate records to reconstruct Pacific climate variability on both high- and low-frequency timescales. Furthermore, the isolation of the IPO signal in a diverse set of isotopic archives invites the reinterpretation of other paleoclimate proxies for identifying this historically overlooked forcing.},
